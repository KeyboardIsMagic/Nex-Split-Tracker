A custom RuneLite plugin that helps you manage parties, display player verification, and capture in-game screenshots—enhancing trust and transparency within the **[OSRS Splits](https://discord.gg/osrssplits)**
 and **RuneWatch** communities.



---

## Overview

This plugin is designed for the **OSRS Splits** community, in accordance with **RuneWatch**, to enhance safety and trust when forming parties to kill Nex and splitting the loot. Party members can create and join parties similarly to the Party Panel plugin, while confirmation of loot splits is tracked within the plugin. With a single button click, this data is sent for verification on our community Discord servers.

When a unique drop from Nex is received, the plugin automatically takes a screenshot and uploads it—along with relevant party information—to our Discord. Verified party members are **tracked permanently**, even if they change their names multiple times, ensuring there’s no way to evade accountability or RuneWatch listings if splitting rules are broken. This promotes trust among verified members, providing a safer environment for everyone involved.

This is an extension of the previous Nex Split Tracker plugin which functionality is still present. Please be patient for more integration features. I would like to continuously improve this plugin to make Nex a better experience for everyone.

## Using the plugin

### Nex Item Drop Tracker
In the Loot Tracker tab you'll find a spreadsheet inspired by the Raid Data Tracker to help track profits from splitting items among friends and squads. 

#### Adding an item to the tracker
1. Select the item you or your party recieved from the drop down menu.
2. Check the box if the item was in your name, otherwise leave this blank.
3. Enter the amount of GP that was given to you for your split amount as a whole number or decimal (***example***: 45 or 45.5)
4. Enter in the team size of the party you recieved the drop with (1,2,3, etc..)
5. Click add drop!

#### Deleting an item from the tracker
1. Right click the desired item on the spreadsheet.
2. Click "Delete"!

### Party Manager
In the Party Manager tab you'll be able to create or join parties much like the Party Panel plugin.

#### Creating a Party
1. Click **Create Party** in the plugin panel.  
2. Enter a **passphrase**   
3. Your party is created, share your passphrase with friends to have them join.

#### Joining a Party
1. Click **Join Party** in the plugin panel.  
2. Enter the **passphrase** provided by the party leader.  




### Confirming Splits & Screenshots
1. **Confirm Split**: Under your username in the party list, toggle **Confirm Split**. Once toggled, it shows “Yes,” indicating you’ve agreed to split loot.  
2. **Screenshot** (Manual): When all members confirm and are on the same world, the leader’s **Screenshot and Upload** button becomes active. This captures the RuneLite client (including the plugin UI) and uploads it (if configured).  
3. **Auto-Screenshots**: The plugin is set to detect unique drops at Nex, it will automatically capture and upload a screenshot whenever a party member receives a unique drop.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

- **Why isn’t my rank icon showing up?**  
  Ensure you’ve entered a valid API key. If the verification server is offline or you don’t have a rank, you’ll appear unverified. Check Discord for updates. https://discord.gg/osrssplits
- **I can’t see my party members.**  
  Double-check the passphrase and confirm everyone is on the same world.
- **No screenshot posted to Discord.**  
  Check Discord for status updates.
- **How do I confirm a split?**  
  In the party list, find your username and click **Confirm Split**. When toggled on, you’ll see “Yes” or it’ll appear in green.
- **I tried added items to the spreadsheet but they are blank or do not work.**  
  This can be due to incorrect values placed inside of either **Split Amount** or **Team Size**. Be sure that any values placed inside of **Split Amount** are whole number or decimals only. A common mistake are users including the 'm' in their drop. If the split you recieved was for 50m, the amount you would enter in would be '50'. **Team Size** only accepts whole numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc.. values such as letters or decimals will result in an incorrect format and might cause the item not to work properly.
